SOURCE_SkeenaNassSockeye_StockInfo.csv

This file is a copy of "Generated_StockInfo.csv"
from the Skeena and Nass Sockeye simulation model data folder.

Include some details re: benchmarks etc here.

The relevant variables have been copied into 
MAIN_CU_LOOKUP_FOR_SOS.csv

- Used SmsyBM80p for the RelAbd_UBM (This is the median posterior estimate
without bias correction for the LTAvg estimate for the Basic Ricker fit -> CONFIRM)

- Got the Sgen estimate from  6_BENCHMARKS/OUTPUT/ValueLookup_BiolBenchmarks.csv
(Again without the bias correction)

- EXCLUDED REL BM FOR PINKUT AND FULTON, GIVEN FITTING ISSUES


Note: given several mismatches between stocks
and the "old" CU delineations, this is using 
a separate set of CU_IDs that match our Stk id
(e.g., SkeenaNassSk_1)

NOTE: The file "Generated_StockInfo_SimUsed.csv" anly has the subset
of stocks that are used in the forward simulation
