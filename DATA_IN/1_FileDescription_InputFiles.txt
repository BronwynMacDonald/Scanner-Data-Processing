DESCRIPTION OF INPUT FILES


Now using:


# SBC Chinook input files sourced from 
# https://github.com/SOLV-Code/SBC-Ck-Dashboards-2.0/tree/master/DATA/DerivedData/2_SummaryOutput
Chinook_SBC_ByPop.csv =    FlatFile_For_COSEWIC_ByPop.csv 
Chinook_SBC_ByCU.csv =    FlatFile_For_COSEWIC_ByCU.csv 

# Fraser Sockeye input files sourced from:
# Tracy Cone files 
# Note: did some separate diagnostics of Annacis File vs. nuSEDS file -> Check folder  DATA_TRACKING
Sockeye_Fraser_ByPop.csv =    SKAll(Aug 2019).csv
# also using code by Bronwyn MacDonald to generate CU level infilled file.
# this also uses the following additional input files
# Sockeye_Fraser_Expansion_Years.csv = Expansion Years.csv
# Sockeye_Fraser_CU_Streams.csv = CU_Streams.csv
# Recruit time series from PSC "sockdat" file, saved here as
# Sockeye_Fraser_SR_Data.csv

# Fraser Coho input files sourced from:
# Bronwyn MacDonald files
Coho_Fraser_ByCU = All IFC CUs BY Table_EC.max=NA_infill=TRUE.csv
Coho_Fraser_ByPop = ALL IFC streams spawners_EC.new=NA, infill=TRUE.csv





NEED TO UPDATE THE REST OF THIS FILE











------------------------------------
 Raw_nuSEDS_FraserSockeye.csv
------------------------------------

Version: April 25, 2019

Notes:
* extracted directly from nuSEDS by Bruce Baxter using the 24 CUs from the 2018 status update
* Added a new PopName_Mod column to distinguish between CUs (e.g. two different "25 Mile River" in two different CUs)
  This new col uses "GEOGRAPHICAL_EXTNT_OF_ESTIMATE" and where needed adds a 3 letter CU identifier (e.g. "25 MILE CREEK" to "
  "25 mile creek estu") or modifies it to match  the pop names used in the Annacis files 
  (e.g. "n. end chilko lake" and "north end chilko lake"). 


To Do
* build quality control and infill(?) steps to mirror SBC CK steps, or just use as a cross check against
  SPN_Sockeye_Fraser_ByPop.csv developed by Tracy Cone at Annacis -> need WG guidance



--------------------------------------
 SPN_Sockeye_Fraser_ByPop.csv
--------------------------------------

Version: March 21, 2019

Notes:
* available file provided by Bronwyn MacDonald
* Added a new PopName_Mod column to distinguish between CUs (e.g. two different "25 Mile River" in two different CUs)
     This new col uses "Stock Name(stream)" and the adds a detail identifier (e.g. "EStu" or "Early") where needed.
		Also fixes spelling discrepancies to match the nuSEDs entry (e.g. "creek, lower" to "creek-lower")

To Do:
* get official latest version from Tracy Cone


-----------------------------------------
 nuSEDS_Prepped_Chinook_SB.csv
-----------------------------------------

Version: April 25, 2019

Notes:
* copied from SBC Ck repo
* This is the raw prepped data (key variables extracted for verified sites, but no quality filtering or infilling yet!)


To Do
* Need to discuss with WG re: which data version to use for SOS
