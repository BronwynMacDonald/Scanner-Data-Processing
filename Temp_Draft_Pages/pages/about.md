# **DFO's State of the Salmon Program**

•	WSP Strategy 1 prescribes standardized monitoring of wild salmon status.
•	Concepts and methods for standardized status assessment under the WSP were developed within a few years of the release of the policy (Holtby and Ciruna 2007, Holt et al. 2009, Holt 2009).
•	However, these methods are not currently being implemented for routine annual status assessments covering the majority of CUs.
