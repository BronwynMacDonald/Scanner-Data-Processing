# **DFO's State of the Salmon Program**

Biodiversity of Canadian Pacific salmon has been broadly declining for decades and climate change is increasing pressures on Pacific salmon populations through complex, interconnected mechanisms at diverse spatial and temporal scales. Therefore the *State of the Salmon Program* is focused on two main research areas: status assessments and climate change adaptation.

# **Status Assessment of Wild Pacific Salmon**

A clear, consistent picture of Pacific salmon status is needed to prioritize recovery efforts and support management decision processes. Without an up-to date picture on how statuses are changing, we can’t assess the effect of climate change pressures relative to other impacts, such as harvest, and we can’t evaluate which specific conservation or recovery measures work best in different settings.

A status assessment tool kit customized for the complex life history 
and population structure of Pacific salmon has been developed. The *State of the Salmon* program is coordinting and supporting local implementation across species and areas.

# **Climate Adaptation**

Some general patterns in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances are emerging, concurrent with climate and habitat changes. Chinook numbers are declining throughout their BC and Yukon range, and sockeye and coho numbers are declining, most notably at southern latitudes. Salmon that spend less time in freshwater, like pink, chum, river-type sockeye, and ocean-type Chinook, are generally not exhibiting long-term declines. These recent observations suggest that not all salmon are equally vulnerable to climate and habitat change.

Improving information on salmon vulnerability to changing climate and habitats will help ensure our fisheries management, salmon recovery, and habitat restoration actions are aligned to future salmon production and biodiversity. To accomplish this, we must integrate and develop new research across disciplines and organizations. One mechanism to improve integration of salmon-ecosystem science across organizations is the formation of a Pacific Salmon-Ecosystem Climate Consortium, which has been recently initiated by our State of the Salmon Program.
